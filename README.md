Hi Kate,

I have just uploaded the code on the GitHub. Below is the repository URL: 

https://github.com/kumarib/QuandlWikiProject.git

Please note: 
1) For the question 1: Done as requested. Also, I have retrieved the whole data, and wrote the code to arrange it for its better legibility.
2) For the question 2: Done as requested.
3) For the optional question 3 (Max Daily Profit): To code this requirement, it requires day's low and day's high values. But the data only provides the values at the time of day open and day close.
4) For the optional question 4 (Busy Days): Done as requested.
5) For the optional question 5 (Biggest Loser): Done as requested.

I have created the output GUI using the JFrame. I have provided comments in my codes for better readability. Also, I have uploaded the output result screenshots for reference.

Please let me know should you need anything else from me.
Thank you,

Sincerely,
Kumari Bhawprita
